### **TimesheetPro – Smart Employee Attendance System**

TimesheetPro is an advanced employee attendance and workforce management system designed to provide **secure, location-based clock-in and clock-out functionality**. The platform leverages **Google OAuth authentication** for seamless and secure employee login, ensuring that only verified users can access the system.

One of its unique features is the **QR-code powered attendance validation**. Employees scan a dynamically generated QR code to initiate the clocking process. The system then checks the employee’s current **geolocation coordinates** against the company’s **predefined office radius**.

* ✅ If the employee is within the allowed radius, the system automatically **grants access and records their clock-in or clock-out time**.
* ❌ If the employee is outside the defined office boundary, the system **restricts access** and prevents unauthorized or fraudulent attendance logging.

This ensures that all attendance records are **accurate, reliable, and location-verified**.

Key Highlights:

* 🔐 **Secure Login**: Uses Google OAuth for authentication, eliminating password-related risks.
* 📍 **Geo-fencing Technology**: Ensures employees can only clock in/out from the office location.
* 🧾 **QR Code Attendance**: Fast, simple, and secure clocking system powered by unique QR codes.
* ⏱ **Automated Tracking**: Real-time logging of employee clock-ins and clock-outs.
* 📊 **Admin Dashboard**: HR or managers can view daily, weekly, and monthly attendance summaries.
* 🚫 **Fraud Prevention**: Prevents remote or unauthorized attendance submissions.

TimesheetPro is perfect for organizations looking to **modernize their attendance management**, **eliminate buddy punching**, and **improve workforce transparency** while leveraging cutting-edge geolocation and authentication technologies.
